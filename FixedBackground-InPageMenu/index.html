                Settled as a small fishing village in the late 12th century, Amsterdam became one of the most
                important trading centres in the world during the Dutch Golden Age of the 17th century. The city's
                small medieval centre rapidly expanded as the Jordaan and the Canal District were constructed; the
                latter's cultural significance was acknowledged when it became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2010.
                In the 19th and 20th centuries, the city expanded in all directions, with many new neighbourhoods
                and suburbs designed in modernist styles.

                Amsterdam is not the seat of the government, which is in The Hague. Partly because of this, the city
                has an informal atmosphere unlike other capital cities its size. In fact, Amsterdam has a history of
                non-conformism, tolerance and progressivism. Attractions include the Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh Museum,
                Anne Frank House, Magere Brug, Albert Cuyp Market and the Vondelpark.
